## 1. Solution Architect Experience

**Question:** 

Looking at the overall architecture of this project—including its separation between the backend (C#.NET Core MVC) and the frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)—what if the application needed to scale to support a significant increase in concurrent users? How would you re-architect or modify the current design to ensure high availability, scalability, and maintainability?

---

## 2. Database Implementation

**Question:** 

The project uses a Postgres database with data-access code integrated within the C#.NET Core application. What if you discovered that the current implementation—possibly using direct SQL or an ORM like Entity Framework—is leading to maintainability issues or data integrity challenges? What changes or improvements would you recommend in the database schema or the data-access layer?

---

## 3. Database Performance for Postgres

**Question:** 

Suppose you start observing performance bottlenecks when running complex queries against the Postgres database in this project. What if you had to optimize these queries and overall database performance? What strategies and Postgres-specific tuning methods would you consider, and how would you integrate these into the current project’s codebase?

---

## 4. Design Patterns

 

**Question:** 

After reviewing the project, you notice that certain parts of the code—such as the controllers and services—could benefit from more robust design patterns. What if you were asked to refactor the application to use appropriate design patterns? Which patterns (such as Repository, Strategy, or Factory) would you introduce, and how would they improve code maintainability and scalability?

 

---

 

## 5. C#.NET Core

 

**Question:** 

Given that the backend is implemented in C#.NET Core, what if you were required to improve the application's performance and responsiveness? How would you leverage advanced .NET Core features, such as asynchronous programming, middleware customization, or new language features, to achieve this goal? Provide examples or theoretical approaches.

 

---

 

## 6. MVC Dependency Injection

 

**Question:** 

In the project, dependency injection is used to manage services and repositories. What if you noticed that some controllers directly instantiate service classes instead of relying on DI? How would you modify the code to improve decoupling and testability, and what best practices would you enforce for proper DI in the MVC framework?

 

---

 

## 7. HTML/CSS Mixed UX Experience

 

**Question:** 

The project includes HTML/CSS components that form the user interface. What if user feedback indicates that the UX is clunky or inconsistent across different browsers? How would you propose enhancing the HTML/CSS structure and integrating responsive design principles to improve user experience without overhauling the existing codebase?

 

---

 

## 8. OOP C# Advanced Reasoning Skills

 

**Question:** 

Review the business logic classes in the C# portion of the project. What if you noticed that some classes exhibit tight coupling and inadequate use of object-oriented principles like polymorphism or encapsulation? How would you refactor these classes to better adhere to SOLID principles, and what benefits would this refactoring provide?

 

---

 

## 9. JavaScript Enhancements

 

**Question:** 

In the client-side code, suppose you need to add new interactive features without negatively impacting the existing functionality. What if you were tasked with modularizing and enhancing the JavaScript code? How would you structure your code—perhaps using modern frameworks or module patterns—to support additional features and maintain code clarity?

 

---

 

## 10. Security Upgrade

 

**Question:** 

Considering the project’s current security measures, what if you discovered potential vulnerabilities such as inadequate authentication controls or data exposure in transit? What comprehensive security upgrade plan would you propose that includes modern best practices—like encryption, secure token management, and input sanitization—to fortify the application?
